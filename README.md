Description:
This C++ program uses ArashPartow's C++ bitmap header-only library (https://github.com/ArashPartow/bitmap), and allows the user to create a randomized wallpaper, and provides 15 different options. Below are example wallpapers that this program has generated, all of which are 1366 by 768 pixels. 

1. Completely randomized - This option randomizes ever single pixel in the bitmap.

2. Black and white squares - This option only makes squares that are black, white, or gray.

3. Gradient tiles - This creates a set of tiles of varying length, each with their own gradient effect.

4. Proportional squares -This option creates squares that cover the screen and are completely random colors.

5. Only some colors - This choice lets the user put a cap on the posible number of colors that can be generated. 5 was entered in this example.

6. Pick your own colors - This choice lets the user pick the colors that will be used by entering how many and their RGB values. 3 colors were chosen in this example.

9. Quadrant gradients - This creates 4 sections that have their own gradient effect.

12. Breakout/Brick Breaker - This creates a randomized screen of the classic arcade games Breakout and Brick Breaker. This randomly generates a position for the paddle relative to the screen height, a position for the ball relative to the paddle, and random colors for the bars towards the top of the screen.

13. Line pattern - This creates a series of lines across the top and sides of the screen, stopping where they meet and originating in the upper left corner.
